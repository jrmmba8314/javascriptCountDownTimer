# javascriptCountDownTimer
Using the moment.js library found at https://momentjs.com/
Using the ProgressBar.js library found at https://kimmobrunfeldt.github.io/progressbar.js/
I created this script to allow for a count down timer on my Moodle classroom website found at http://cybersecurity.portangelesschools.org
* thisone.html - a simple script that appears on the home page
* circleone.html - a script that shows the count down progress through a series of circles.
