# javascriptCountDownTimer
Using the moment.js library found at https://momentjs.com/<br>
Using the ProgressBar.js library found at https://kimmobrunfeldt.github.io/progressbar.js/<br>
I created this script to allow for a count down timer on my Moodle classroom website found at http://cybersecurity.portangelesschools.org<br>
* thisone.html - a simple script that appears on the home page<br>
* circleone.html - a script that shows the count down progress through a series of circles.<br>
